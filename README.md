# ACTION: TYPO3 Documentation on Github

⚙️ Github Action to build and trigger the deployment of a documentation in TYPO3 .rst style

Look at the folder structure in the Folder "Example" to see how to use this action.
Note that you may have to set up your Documentation like TYPO3 does it. 
See the [TYPO3 Documentation](https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3docs-examples/tree/main/Documentation) for more information.

To set up your local environment for building the documentation, 
I would like to refer to my valued colleague [Armin Vieweg](https://github.com/a-r-m-i-n) and
his local environment in his extension: [Fluid Page Cache](https://github.com/a-r-m-i-n/fluid_page_cache).
